	abstract = {We live in a world rich with data, where use and reuse would benefit not just science but also serve national security and society-at-large. Air quality impacts from forest fires, which are increasing in frequency, is one example of large, data-intensive science with societal impacts. Understanding long-range transport of smoke where I started my career and worked with Dr. Greg Leptoukh, for whom this lecture is named, required a variety of datasets from satellite, surface observations and models. Together with Greg, we formed the ESIP Air Quality Cluster, a community of practice, to determine which and how to use data access standards and metadata standards agreed to best support the broader Air Quality research community. Forest fire smoke analysis was based on datasets not originally intended for our purpose, but because the data was findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) and we were willing to reuse it, we reduced the time to wrangle data and were able to ask and answer new questions about each smoke event. Today, we are seeing more and more examples like mine of science that was not possible without open data, standards and tools. However, our scientific data enterprise is evolving and maturing in an unmanaged fashion and due to insufficient coordination across planning, management, and resources, the potential benefits of all these data and distributed infrastructure are not fully realized. Reliable, long term funding as well as cultural changes including financial incentives and rewards are needed to turn Science Data Infrastructure into a first class citizen equal to Science. This talk will explore what it means to put data to work and explore the relationship between data-intensive science, data management and collaborative community efforts like the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) and Openscapes to move science forward beyond where we thought possible!},

In this paper, we elaborate basic principles of a reproducible data analysis workflow by defining 3 phases: the Explore, Refine, and Produce Phases. Each phase is roughly centered around the audience to whom research decisions, methodologies, and results are being immediately communicated. Importantly, each phase can also give rise to a number of research products beyond traditional academic publications. Where relevant, we draw analogies between design principles and established practice in software development. The guidance provided here is not intended to be a strict rulebook; rather, the suggestions for practices and tools to advance reproducible, sound data-intensive analysis may furnish support for both students new to research and current researchers who are new to data-intensive work.},

	title = {A survey of researchers' needs and priorities for data sharing},
	url = {https://osf.io/njr5u},
	abstract = {PLOS has long supported Open Science. One of the ways in which we do so is via our stringent data availability policy established in 2014. Despite this policy, and more data sharing policies being introduced by other organizations, best practices for data sharing are adopted by a minority of researchers in their publications. Problems with effective research data sharing persist and these problems have been quantified by previous research as a lack of time, resources, incentives, and/or skills to share data. In this study we built on this research by investigating the importance of tasks associated with data sharing, and researchers{\textquoteright} satisfaction with their ability to complete these tasks. By investigating these factors we aimed to better understand opportunities for new or improved solutions for sharing data. In May-June 2020 we surveyed researchers from Europe and North America to rate tasks associated with data sharing on (i) their importance and (ii) their satisfaction with their ability to complete them. We received 728 completed and 667 partial responses. We calculated mean importance and satisfaction scores to highlight potential opportunities for new solutions to and compare different cohorts.Tasks relating to research impact, funder compliance, and credit had the highest importance scores. 52{\textbackslash}\% of respondents reuse research data but the average satisfaction score for obtaining data for reuse was relatively low. Tasks associated with sharing data were rated somewhat important and respondents were reasonably well satisfied in their ability to accomplish them. Notably, this included tasks associated with best data sharing practice, such as use of data repositories. However, the most common method for sharing data was in fact via supplemental files with articles, which is not considered to be best practice.We presume that researchers are unlikely to seek new solutions to a problem or task that they are satisfied in their ability to accomplish, even if many do not attempt this task. This implies there are few opportunities for new solutions or tools to meet these researcher needs. Publishers can likely meet these needs for data sharing by working to seamlessly integrate existing solutions that reduce the effort or behaviour change involved in some tasks, and focusing on advocacy and education around the benefits of sharing data. There may however be opportunities - unmet researcher needs - in relation to better supporting data reuse, which could be met in part by strengthening data sharing policies of journals and publishers, and improving the discoverability of data associated with published articles.},

A powerpoint version of the slides is available upon request from ontosoft@gmail.com.

These OntoSoft training materials were developed and edited by Yolanda Gil (USC), with contributions from the OntoSoft team including Chris Duffy (PSU), Chris Mattmann (JPL), Scott Pechkam (CU), Ji-Hyun Oh (USC), Varun Ratnakar (USC), Erin Robinson (ESIP). They were significantly improved through input from pioneer authors Cedric David (JPL), Ibrahim Demir (UI), Bakinam Essawy (UV), Robinson W. Fulweiler (BU), Jon Goodall (UV), Leif Karlstrom (UO), Kyo Lee (JPL), Heath Mills (UH), Suzanne Pierce (UT), Allen Pope (CU), Mimi Tzeng (DISL), Karan Venayagamoorthy (CSU), Sandra Villamizar (UC), and Xuan Yu (UD). Others contributed with feedback on best practices, including Ruth Duerr (NSIDC), James Howison (UT), Matt Jones (UCSB), Lisa Kempler (Matworks), Kerstin Lehnert (LDEO), Matt Meyernick (NCAR), and Greg Wilson (Software Carpentry). These materials were also improved thanks to the many scientists and colleagues that have taken the training and asked hard questions.},

These datasets and their requisite metadata can be managed by queryable databases. Geospatial Web application programming interfaces (APIs) provide remote access to dynamic subsets of environmental information. Persistent identifiers make data citable. The storage-computing trade-off is now heavily skewed in favor of moving calculations to the data. Provenance metadata help determine a data object's reliability and trustworthiness. Rising atmospheric CO2, the Antarctic ozone hole, and Gulf Stream warm-core rings were all discovered by analyzing long-term datasets. Similar work continues on mapping evapotranspiration and snow water equivalent. In these {\textquotedblleft}fourth paradigm{\textquotedblright} problems, data (especially data collected operationally) drive hypothesis formation. Making data available requires new discovery mechanisms and policies favoring data sharing. Cloud computing and array-friendly databases will help bring processing to the data.

To better understand this relationship, we studied the tools used to forecast and respond to sea-level rise in the San Francisco Bay Area, where active debates on how to best prepare for this issues are underway and will have important consequences for the future of the region. Drawing on 18 months of qualitative research we argue that competing visions of the problem are intimately intertwined with different elements of information infrastructure and beliefs about the role of data in policymaking. Current infrastructure in the region, far from being a neutral actor in these debates, exhibits an infrastructural bias, privileging some approaches over others. We identify some of the tactics that community organizations deploy to subvert the claims of sea-level rise experts and advance their own perspective, which prioritizes considerations of justice over technical expertise.},

This chapter traces the intellectual and institutional roots of the category of infrastructure in the development debates of the 1950s: its affinity with the earlier idea of social overhead capital and its mobiliza- tion in the conflict between the United Nations and the World Bank surrounding the financing of development investment. I argue that debates about development aid shifted attention from an economic definition of infrastructure towards one framed more in terms of general prerequisites. Analyzing this expansive category of infra- structure, which remains largely in place today, gives insight into the territoriality of the post-colonial world and challenges exclusively physical or engineering-based ideas of infrastructure.},

We use case studies of the Open Web, Facebook, and Google to demonstrate that infrastructure studies provides a valuable approach to the evolution of shared, widely accessible systems and services of the type often provided or regulated by governments in the public interest. On the other hand, platform studies captures how communication and expression are both enabled and constrained by new digital systems and new media. In these environments, platform-based services acquire characteristics of infrastructure, while both new and existing infrastructures are built or reorganized on the logic of platforms. We conclude by underlining the potential of this combined framework for future case studies.},

	abstract = {Natural disasters bring to the fore the astounding interdependence and fragility of the complex mobility systems and infrastructural moorings that make up contemporary transnational geographies. Cities - and especially entire islands - suffering catastrophic events are illustrative of how the dynamic intertwining of transportation, communication, provisioning, and scheduling systems can rapidly unravel. Through an analysis of the aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake in Haiti, this article examines how natural disasters demobilize and remobilize; how they strike at mobility systems and trouble mobility justice; and also engender their own unique mobilities (and immobilities). Through an analysis of the uneven network capital expended as humanitarian mobility into post-earthquake Port-au-Prince (with comparison to post-hurricane New Orleans) it is shown how post-disaster logistics simultaneously produce disconnections, limit capabilities for mobility, and introduce what is theorized as an 'islanding effect' on the victims of the disaster. This is further delineated through close analysis of two crucial post-earthquake reconfigurations: the militarization of air mobilities and the humanitarian use of aerial visioning technologies and GIS in the emergency response. US military control of the international airport and use of aerial surveillance and geo-mapping for disaster response reinforced existing uneven mobility regimes, which subject marginalized and racialized populations of the Caribbean to enhanced border control, migrant interdiction and criminalization. Through the disaster response itself, rapid deployment of these new (im)mobility infrastructures deepened spatial inequalities, diminished mobility justice, and reproduced subjects with differential mobility capability. The article also considers counter-geographies and resistance to the injustices of post-disaster mobility regimes. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.},

Access to data, samples, methods, and reagents used to conduct research and analysis, as well as to the code used to analyze and process data and samples, is a fundamental requirement for transparency and reproducibility. The field sciences (e.g., geology, ecology, and archaeology), where each study is temporally (and often spatially) unique, provide exemplars for the importance of preserving data and samples for further analysis. Yet field sciences, if they even address such access, commonly do so by simply noting {\textquotedblleft}data and samples available upon request.{\textquotedblright} They lag behind some laboratory sciences in making data and samples available to the broader research community. It is time for this to change. We discuss cultural, financial, and technical barriers to change and ways in which funders, publishers, scientific societies, and others are responding.},

	abstract = {Founded in early 2018 through a collaboration between the EU Horizon 2020 AtlantOS project and Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, the Global Omics Observatory Network (GLOMICON) is federating long-term ecological observatories employing "omic" (e.g. metagenomcis, metatranscriptomics, metabolomics) techniques to assess biodiversity across scales. GLOMICON is the consolidation of a series of meetings and ad hoc efforts (e.g. the multi-omic sessions at TDWG 2017) and seeks to mainstream multi-omic observation in existing observatory systems. GLOMICON currently networks \&gt;40 organisations observing biodiversity from urban and agricultural systems to the depths of the polar ocean. Coordination through GLOMICON allows the long-term observatory community to develop and align their needs, thus approaching standards bodies including the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC), the Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) organisation, and the Earth Science Information Partners (ESIP) with a common voice. Further, as more ecological observatories begin to adopt molecular techniques, GLOMICON offers a community building best practices to facilitate their operationalisation. Vitally, GLOMICON interfaces with established observation networks via organisations such as UNESCO/IOC Global Ocean Observing System through its Biology and Ecosystems Panel. Such interactions have provided invaluable guidance on how to approach global standardisation in a firmly operational and multi-stakeholder environment, while ensuring innovative science can thrive.In this contribution, we will deliver a briefing on GLOMICON's current priorities and efforts to shape molecular standards to become fit-for-purpose in observatory-grade settings. In particular, we will focus on our interactions with other key omic observing networks, including the Genomic Observatories Network, and our joint strategies to progress towards an distributed yet integrated system. We will also note practical steps the network has taken to systematise protocols and best practices, (bio)informatics routines, observatory parameters, and global intercalibration through sample exchange. Lastly, we will note the network's upcoming priorities, which feature the need to develop strategies for sustainability and the extension of coordination efforts between national, regional, and global Earth observation systems.},

The results of this research suggest the following key takeaways: (1) Most PIs practice internal data management in order to prevent data loss, to facilitate sharing within the research team, and to seamlessly continue their research during personnel turnover; (2) PIs still have room to grow in understanding specialized concepts such as metadata and policies for use and reuse; (3) PIs may need guidance on practices that facilitate FAIR data, such as using metadata standards, assigning licenses to their data, and publishing in data repositories. Ultimately, the results of this research can inform academic library services and support stronger, more actionable DMPs.},

Calculate programmatically whether researchers in Earth Science rely on a smaller subset of literature than estimated by the 80/20 rule. Determine whether these reproducible citation analysis methods can be used to analyze open access uptake. Methods: Replicated methods of a prior citation study provide an updated transparent, reproducible citation analysis protocol that can be replicated with Jupyter Notebooks. Results: This study replicated the prior citation study{\textquoteright}s conclusions, and also adapted the author{\textquoteright}s methods to analyze the citation practices of Earth Scientists at four institutions. We found that 80\% of the citations could be accounted for by only 7.88\% of journals, a key metric to help identify a core collection of titles in this discipline. We then demonstrated programmatically that 36\% of these cited references were available as open access. Conclusions: Jupyter Notebooks are a viable platform for disseminating replicable processes for citation analysis. A completely open methodology is emerging and we consider this a step forward. Adherence to the 80/20 rule aligned with institutional research output, but citation preferences are evident. Reproducible citation analysis methods may be used to analyze open access uptake, however, results are inconclusive. It is difficult to determine whether an article was open access at the time of citation, or became open access after an embargo.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	url = {http://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/49353},
	abstract = {Executive Summary National Science Foundation support for scientific cyberinfrastructure dates to the 1960s. Since about 2000, however, efforts in cyberinfrastructure development have gathered momentum, guided by an increasingly comprehensive vision. Yet assembling the range of NSF-sponsored projects into a genuine infrastructure highly reliable, widely accessible basic capabilities and services supporting the full range of scientific work remains an elusive goal. Close study of other infrastructures, from railroads and electric power grids to telephone, cellular services, and the Internet, provides insights that can help guide and consolidate the NSF vision. Since the 1980s, historians, sociologists, and information scientists have been studying how and why infrastructures form and evolve; how they work; and how they (sometimes) disintegrate or fail. In September 2006, a three-day NSF-funded workshop on History and Theory of Infrastructure: Lessons for New Scientific Cyberinfrastructures took place at the University of Michigan. Participants included experts in social and historical studies of infrastructure development, and domain scientists, information scientists, and NSF program officers involved in building, using, and funding cyberinfrastructure. The goal was to distill concepts, stories, metaphors, and parallels that might help realize the NSF vision for scientific cyberinfrastructure. This report summarizes the workshop findings, and outlines a research agenda for the future. Social and historical analyses reveal some base-level tensions that complicate the work of infrastructural development. These include: Time, e.g. short-term funding decisions vs. the longer time scales over which infrastructures typically grow and take hold Scale, e.g. disconnects between global interoperability and local optimization Agency, e.g. navigating processes of planned vs. emergent change in complex and multiply-determined systems. Such complications challenge simple notions of infrastructure building as a planned, orderly, and mechanical act. They also suggest that boundaries between technical and social solutions are mobile, in both directions: the path between the technological and the social is not static and there is no one correct mapping. Robust cyberinfrastructure will develop only when social, organizational, and cultural issues are resolved in tandem with the creation of technology-based services. Sustained and proactive attention to these concerns will be critical to long-term success. Dynamics. Historical infrastructures the automobile/gasoline/roadway system, electrical grids, railways, telephony, and most recently the Internet become ubiquitous, accessible, reliable, and transparent as they mature. The initial stage in infrastructure formation is system-building, characterized by the deliberate and successful design of technology-based services. Next, technology transfer across domains and locations results in variations on the original design, as well as the emergence of competing systems. Infrastructures typically form only when these various systems merge, in a process of consolidation characterized by gateways that allow dissimilar systems to be linked into networks. In this phase, standardization and inter-organizational communication techniques are critical. As multiple systems assemble into networks, and networks into webs or internetworks, early choices constrain the options available moving forward, creating what historical economists call path dependence. Tensions. Transparent, reliable infrastructural services create vast benefits, but there are always losers as well as winners in infrastructure formation. Questions of ownership, management, control, and access are always present. For example: Who decides on rules and conventions for sharing, storing, and preserving data? Local variation vs. global standards: how do we resolve frictions between localized routines and cultures that stand in the way of effective collaboration? How can national cyberinfrastructure development move forward without compromising possibilities for international or even global infrastructure formation? Design. These and other tensions inherent to infrastructure growth present imperatives to develop navigation strategies that recognize the likelihood of unforeseen (and potentially negative) path dependence and/or institutional or cultural barriers to adoption. Cyberinfrastructure seeks to enable a decentralized research environment that: 1) permits distributed collaboration; 2) provides incentives for participation at all levels; and 3) encourages the advancement of cross-boundary and interdisciplinary scholarship. Since all three of these goals are simultaneously social and organizational in nature and central to the technical base, designing effective navigation strategies will depend on strategic collaborations between social, domain, and information scientists. In particular, comparative studies of cyberinfrastructure projects can reveal key factors in success (and failure). Research on practices of standardization and modularity can help retain the openness, flexibility, and broad-scale usability of cyberinfrastructure, minimizing the path-dependent effects of standard-setting. Recommendations: NSF should consider action in three broad areas. Learning from cyberinfrastructure. By applying well-understood evaluation tools, we can assess and compare existing cyberinfrastructure projects, both in the US and abroad. The resulting knowledge can be used to improve reporting mechanisms and incentive structures. Cyberinfrastructure projects can also be instrumented to collect social and organizational data. Improving cyberinfrastructural practice. Social science research can assist with NSF goals of training and enrolling professionals into the cyberinfrastructure-based research agenda. These goals may be achieved in part by improving diagnostics for current research environments, providing direct training for information managers, graduate students, and early-career faculty, and developing funding structures that support work on multiple time scales. Enhancing resilience, sustainability, and reach. Since infrastructures develop by creating links among varied systems, the NSF agenda may be promoted by forging and strengthening connections outside academic and governmental channels. Social scientists can help to recruit under-represented groups and institutions, as well as to create partnerships with organizations that have substantial existing expertise in areas complementary to scientific research, such as intellectual property standards and management.},

	abstract = {Our 2012 workshop, Knowledge Infrastructures: Intellectual Frameworks and Research Challenges, identified three themes (Edwards et al., 2013): 1. How are knowledge infrastructures changing? 2. How do knowledge infrastructures reinforce or redistribute authority, influence, and power? 3. How can we best study, know, and imagine today's (and tomorrow's) knowledge infrastructures? Our 2020 workshop, about half of whose participants attended the event eight years earlier, takes those three themes as points of departure, asking what we have learned in the interim, and what research directions are most (and least) promising to pursue at this juncture. Among the outcomes of the 2012 workshop was creating the UCLA Center for Knowledge Infrastructures. Having founded and directed that Center, the 2020 workshop is an opportunity to reflect on the three questions identified by the current collaboration. 1. What are the most urgent research questions to address about KI? Why? The phrase knowledge infrastructures has gained some currency in scholarly, government, business, and other literatures since the 2013 workshop report, but never acquired the popularity of related terms such as platform and big data. To the extent that Google Scholar metrics are considered valid or reliable, a notable datapoint is that the report itself has garnered about 200 citations in six years. One question to address is what are knowledge infrastructures? How do they differ from platforms, cyberinfrastructure, global information infrastructure, and other technology metaphors for infrastructure? This general question encompasses a number of specific questions to address in the 2020 workshop, such as: a. What are the benefits of KI approaches to solving or framing problems? How do these approaches differ from other social or socio-technical approaches? b. What research methods are most appropriate for asking KI questions? c. Where does KI fit in academic curricula? Information science? Data science? Sociology? Science and technology studies? Computer science? Systems theory? d. Is KI a concept useful at the undergraduate level? Is it best reserved for postgraduate level inquiry?},

While there are widely adopted conventions within certain domains to describe sample data, these have gaps when applied in a multidisciplinary context. In this study, we reviewed existing practices~for identifying, characterizing, and linking related environmental samples. We then tested practicalities of assigning persistent identifiers to samples, with standardized metadata, in a pilot field test involving eight United States Department of Energy projects. Participants collected a variety of sample types, with analyses conducted across multiple facilities. We address terminology gaps for multidisciplinary research and make recommendations for assigning identifiers and metadata that supports sample tracking, integration, and reuse.

	abstract = {The participatory design of CSCW systems increasingly embraces activities of reconfiguring the use of existing interconnected systems in addition to developing and implementing new. In this article, we refer to such activities of changing and improving collaboration through the means of existing information infrastructures as infrastructuring. We investigate a relational perspective on infrastructuring and provide an overview and a detailed account of a local infrastructuring process by tracing the concrete relations that emerged. The elusive quality of information infrastructures as being invisible is analyzed through the notion of infrastructural inversion. Infrastructural inversion is the gestalt switch of shifting attention from the activities invisibly supported by an infrastructure to the activities that enable the infrastructure to function and meet desired needs for collaborative support. Initially, infrastructural inversion was conceived as a conceptual-analytic notion, but recent research has also positioned it as an empirical-ethnographic and generative-designerly resource. In this study, we rely on all of these stances and contribute to the generative-designerly position. We explain the notion of infrastructural inversion and describe how it is distinct from the CSCW concept of articulation work. The context of the analysis includes a participatory design project that sought to reduce patients{\textquoteright} fasting time prior to surgical operations by improving the interdepartmental coordination at a hospital. The project revealed the webs of relations and interdependencies in which fasting time is inscribed at the local level as well as regionally, nationally, and beyond. We pursue the relations, trace their connectedness across multiple scopes, and show how the process alternated between empirical and analytic activities of exploring relations and design-oriented activities of reaching closure. Our analysis shows that the notion of infrastructural inversion can enrich participatory design: Infrastructural inversion embraces the exploratory activities of tracing relations, while the design agenda drove the need for reaching closure. We conclude by discussing lessons learned for infrastructuring and for participatory design that engages with infrastructuring.},

The time and skill in integrating computing into the labor processes of research are often significant "hidden costs" of computerization. The key role played by computing infrastructure in reducing these costs may be enhanced by careful organization. We illustrate computerization strategies that we have found to be productive and unproductive. Appropriate computerization strategies depend as much on the structuring of resources and interests in the larger social setting as on a techmcal characterization of tasks.

Infrastructure is both relational and ecological{\textemdash}it means different things to different groups and it is part of the balance of action, tools, and the built environment, inseparable from them. It also is frequently mundane to the point of boredom, involving things such as plugs, standards, and bureaucratic forms. Some of the difficulties of studying infrastructure are how to scale up from traditional ethnographic sites, how to manage large quantities of data such as those produced by transaction logs, and how to understand the interplay of online and offline behavior. Some of the tricks of the trade involved in meeting these challenges include studying the design of infrastructure, understanding the paradoxes of infrastructure as both transparent and opaque, including invisible work in the ecological analysis, and pinpointing the epistemological status of indictors.},

On tropical islands populations of different invasive rat species can co-exist on very small islands, but the population dynamics of such co-existing rat species, their impact on each other, and the mechanisms of coexistence are not well known. This lack of knowledge is a barrier to improving the success rate of tropical island rat eradications. Through an exhaustive trapping eradication campaign on a small tropical island, we study the population structure of historically established Rattus exulans where R. rattus have colonised within the last fifty years and over-invaded. We contrast this R. exulans population with a nearby island population where R. exulans exist alone. Recently invaded R. rattus numerically and morphologically dominate R. exulans; however stable isotope analyses show that the trophic position of R. exulans remains consistent regardless of the presence of R. rattus, once differences in trophic foundations of islands are accounted for. Although the trophic position of both rat species is indistinguishable, R. rattus is able to dominate R. exulans through interference competition. Our eradication attempt was interrupted by a tropical cyclone and ultimately unsuccessful, but there is some evidence that R. rattus reduced control device availability to R. exulans, which has important implications for multi-species control operations.},

Infrastructure Studies simultaneously addresses the technical, social, and organizational aspects of the development, usage, and maintenance of infrastructures in local communities as well as global arenas. While infrastructure is understood as a broad category referring to a variety of pervasive, enabling network resources such as railroad lines, plumbing and pipes, electrical power plants and wires, this article focuses on information infrastructure, such as computational services and help desks, or federating activities such as scientific data repositories and archives spanning the multiple disciplines needed to address such issues as climate warming and the biodiversity crisis. These are elements associated with the internet and, frequently today, associated with cyberinfrastructure or e-science endeavors. We argue that a theoretical understanding of infrastructure provides the context for needed dialogue between design, use, and sustainability of internet-based infrastructure services. This article outlines a research area and outlines overarching themes of Infrastructure Studies. Part one of the paper presents definitions for infrastructure and cyberinfrastructure, reviewing salient previous work. Part two portrays key ideas from infrastructure studies (knowledge work, social and political values, new forms of sociality, etc.). In closing, the character of the field today is considered.},

To ground our investigation, we briefly examine research in Scotland{\textquoteright}s marine energy sector as the nation pursues a transition from an energy sector heavily reliant on oil and gas, to one based on renewable energy innovation and implementation. Via this case, we illustrate that a great deal of the {\textquoteleft}old{\textquoteright} knowledge infrastructures for energy research, rather than being wholly swept away, instead persist across energy transitions. The concept of knowledge infrastructures provides a powerful addition to energy social science because they are fundamental to our ability to research and develop renewable energy technologies, and so play an important role in defining possible energy futures.},

Despite the increased use of public social media posts and other public data in research, there have been few conversations about the ethics of the use of this data, with Wolff (2018) and McKee and Porter (2009) as exceptions. This article considers ethical concerns for the use of social media data by writing researchers and provides a heuristic for using and publishing {\textquotedblleft}public{\textquotedblright} data. The framework in this chapter consists of four parts: 1) an analysis of the privacy policies and options provided by the social media platform being studied; 2) a consideration for how these policies are enacted by users; 3) concerns with using data in a study; 4) how best to publish data from the study. A more nuanced consideration of public data that places this information on a continuum rather than employing a public/private binary will result in a more ethical use of social media data. Using common research situations and examples, we engage with the challenges of public data to propose an ethical process for other social media researchers.},

	abstract = {Man-computer symbiosis is an expected development in cooperative interaction between men and electronic computers. It will involve very close coupling between the human and the electronic members of the partnership. The main aims are 1) to let computers facilitate formulative thinking as they now facilitate the solution of formulated problems, and 2) to enable men and computers to cooperate in making decisions and controlling complex situations without inflexible dependence on predetermined programs. In the anticipated symbiotic partnership, men will set the goals, formulate the hypotheses, determine the criteria, and perform the evaluations. Computing machines will do the routinizable work that must be done to prepare the way for insights and decisions in technical and scientific thinking. Preliminary analyses indicate that the symbiotic partnership will perform intellectual operations much more effectively than man alone can perform them. Prerequisites for the achievement of the effective, cooperative association include developments in computer time sharing, in memory components, in memory organization, in programming languages, and in input and output equipment.},

	abstract = {In 1960, J. C. R. Licklider, a well respected academician and professional, published an article entitled, {\textquotedblleft}Man-Computer Symbiosis,{\textquotedblright} in the fledgling research journal, the IRE (Institute of Radio Engineers) Transactions on Human Factors in Electronics. Reflecting back on its publication, Internet historians and Internet pioneers consistently cite the influential nature of the article in predicting the Internet's development. Using diffusion of innovations and the agenda setting function as the theoretical framework, this study examines the influence network produced by a set of articles that cite Licklider from 1960{\textendash}2001. The purpose of the study is to investigate the spread and influence of the ideas expressed in {\textquotedblleft}Man-Computer Symbiosis{\textquotedblright} among published citing works in order to clarify our understanding about the article's contributions. Diffusion of innovations assists in explaining the spread of Licklider's ideas among citing authors. Agenda setting offers insight into the events in Licklider's career that positioned him to publish {\textquotedblleft}Man-Computer Symbiosis{\textquotedblright} while also identifying the salience of particular ideas over others in citing authors' works.
Citation analysis and quantitative content analysis are combined to produce the data set. Citation analysis identifies the influence network for {\textquotedblleft}Man-Computer Symbiosis,{\textquotedblright} as represented by a set of citing authors. Quantitative content analysis examines the appearance of Licklider's ideas within the article citations. Study results indicate that of the 110 citing articles examined, the idea for symbiosis was most frequently cited. In general, the hierarchy of ideas presented in {\textquotedblleft}Man-Computer Symbiosis{\textquotedblright} was reflected overall in the citing authors' hierarchy. The majority of citing authors were academicians affiliated with top-tier institutions who published in well-respected science/technology outlets. Citations to {\textquotedblleft}Man-Computer Symbiosis{\textquotedblright} have remained relatively stable during a 40-year period, and the article continues to diffuse slowly but steadily among the research community.},

Drawing on previous work examining the digital queer gestures of drag queen educators (Liz{\'a}rraga \& Cortez, 2019), this essay explores how non-dominant people that exist and fluctuate in the in-between of boundaries of gender, race, sexuality, the physical, and the virtual provide pedagogical overtures for imagining and organizing for new possible futures that are equitable and just. Further animated by Donna Haraway{\textquoteright}s (2006) influential feminist post-humanist work, we interrogate how Latinx drag queens as cyborgs use digital technologies to enhance their craft and engage in powerful pedagogical moves. This essay draws from robust analyses of the digital presence of and interviews with two Latinx drag queens in the San Francisco Bay Area, as well as the online presence of a Xicanx doggie drag queen named RuPawl. Our participants actively drew on their liminality to provoke and mobilize communities around socio-political issues. In this regard, we see them engaging in transformative public cyborg joter{\'i}a pedagogies that are made visible and historicized in the digital and physical world.},

I argue that an {\textquotedblleft}implicit feudalism{\textquotedblright} informs the available options for community management on the Internet{\textquoteright}s most popular platforms for online communities. This pattern grants user-administrators absolutist reign over their fiefdoms, with competition among them as the primary mechanism for quality control, under rules set by the meta-absolutism of platform companies. Through experience in communities so constituted, users may be learning to trust effective absolutism, even if it is relatively rare, and distrust their own capacity for self-governance. In light of alternative management mechanisms with more democratic features, it becomes all the more clear that implicit feudalism is not a necessary condition.},

Drawing from discourses of data literacy; epistemic agency and lived experience; and critical race theory, we analyze the workshops{\textquoteright} activities and outcomes. Through this analysis, three themes emerge: the tensions between epistemic agency and the context of work, encountering the ordinariness of racism through data work, and understanding the personal as communal and intersectional. Finally, critical race theory also prompts us to consider the very notions of data literacy that undergird our workshop activities. From this analysis, we offer a series of suggestions for approaching designing data literacy activities, taking into account critical race theory.},

This paper develops a heuristic of collaborative rhythms and points to the work of temporal alignment as a neglected but crucial element underpinning distributed collective practice in the sciences (and other spheres of collective activity). Specifically, we argue that joint scientific work is organized around four separate registers, or 'rhythms' - organizational, infrastructural, biographical, and phenomenal - and that efforts to align such rhythms constitute an important and under-recognized aspect of collaborative work. The ideas and examples are drawn from our own field studies around IT infrastructure and collaborative practice across a range of scientific fields.},

	abstract = {Today, millions of people are learning to ski in just a few days instead of the months it took to learn twenty years ago. In this paper, we analyze the new methods of teaching skiing in terms of a computational paradigm for learning called increasingly complex microworlds ICM. Examining the factors that underly the dramatic enhancement of the learning of skiing led us to focus on the processes of simplification, debugging, and coaching. We study these three processes in detail, showing how the structure of each is affected by the basic skills required to perform a task, the equipment involved in its execution, and the environment in which the skill is executed. Throughout, we draw parallels between the process of learning to ski and learning computer programming and problem-solving. Our goal is to achieve insight into the complex issues of skill acquisition and design of learning environments -- especially computer-based ones -- through the analysis of the intuitively understandable domain of ski instruction.

But many growing areas of CSCW work, including mobile, cloud, and social computing, run into problems precisely at this intersection. This paper presents a model for understanding processes of change and emergence in social computing in which policy, practice, and design show up in the form of complex interdependencies, or knots, that collectively determine the shape, meaning, and trajectory of shifting computational forms. We then apply this model to two recent social computing controversies: the 2011 privacy scandal surrounding the location-aware mobile app Girls Around Me; and controversies surrounding the 2010 launch of the Google Buzz social network. We argue that better attention to the mutually constitutive relations between design, practice and policy can expand the reach, depth, and impact of CSCW scholarship.},

Cultures of participation represent foundations for the next generation of collaborative systems by supporting all stakeholders to participate actively in personally meaningful problems. Meta-design supports cultures of participation by defining and creating social and technical infrastructures in which users can choose to become designers. These developments create new discourses in human-computer interaction (HCI), complementing and transcending current approaches centered on interaction.

	abstract = {Purpose The digitalization of society results in challenges and opportunities for learning and education. This paper describes exemplary transformations from current to future practices. It illustrates multi-dimensional aspects of learning which complement and transcend current frameworks of learning focused on schools. While digital technologies are necessary for these transformations, they are not sufficient. The paper briefly illustrates the applicability of the conceptual framework to the COVID-19 pandemic. It concludes that design opportunities and design trade-offs in relation to digital technologies and learning should be explored by envisioning the cultural transformation that are desirable for making learning a part of life. Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on the work conducted at the symposium {\textquotedblleft}Rethinking and Reinventing Learning, Education, and Collaboration in the Digital Age{\textemdash}From Creating Technologies to Transforming Cultures{\textquotedblright} that took place in Engeltofta outside of G{\"a}vle, Sweden in September 2019. The symposium invited scholars in collaborative analysis of design opportunities and design trade-offs in relation to digital technologies and learning and explored design strategies for systematically and proactively increasing digital technology's contributions to learning and collaborating. The paper first provides a condensed introduction of a conceptual framework summarizing current practices, their problems and promising alternatives. Multi-dimensional aspects of learning and lifelong learning will be briefly described as promising future alternatives to school learning. Examples of transformative practices are supporting the major argument of the paper that creating new technologies is an important prerequisite to address the fundamental challenge of transforming cultures. The unanticipated but fundamental event of the occurrence of COVID-19 will be briefly described to provide further evidence for the need and the applicability of our conceptual framework for rethinking and reinventing learning, education and collaboration in the digital age. Findings The paper provides a condensed introduction of a conceptual framework summarizing current practices, their problems and promising alternatives. The framework includes multi-dimensional aspects of learning and lifelong learning as a promising future alternative to a focus on school learning. Originality/value This paper describes exemplary transformations from current to future practices. It illustrates multi-dimensional aspects of learning which complement and transcend current frameworks of learning focused on schools.},

	abstract = {In a world that is not predictable, improvisation, evolution, and innovation are more than a luxury: they are a necessity. The challenge of design is not a matter of getting rid of the emergent, but rather of including it and making it an opportunity for more creative and more adequate solutions to problems.Meta-design is an emerging conceptual framework aimed at defining and creating social and technical infrastructures in which new forms of collaborative design can take place. It extends the traditional notion of system design beyond the original development of a system to include a coadaptive process between users and a system, inwhich the users become co-developers or co-designers. It is grounded in the basic assumption that future uses and problems cannot be completely anticipated at design time, when a system is developed. Users, at use time, will discover mismatches between their needs and the support that an existing system can provide for them. These mismatches will lead to breakdowns that serve as potential sources of new insights, new knowledge, and new understanding. This chapter is structured in four parts: conceptual framework, environments, applications, and findings and challenges. Along the structure of the chapter, we discuss and explore the following essential components of meta-design, providing requirements, guidelines, and models for the future of end-user development: (1) the relationship of meta-design to other design methodologies; (2) the Seeding, Evolutionary Growth, Reseeding Model, a process model for large evolving design artifacts; (3) the characteristics of unself-conscious cultures of design, their strengths and their weaknesses, and the necessity for owners of problems to be empowered to engage in end-user development; (4) the possibilities created by meta-design to bring co-creation alive; and (5) the need for an integrated design space that brings together a technical infrastructure that is evolvable, for the design of learning environments and work organizations that allow end-users to become active contributors, and for the design of relational settings in which users can relate, find motivations and rewards, and accumulate social capital.Key words. co-creation, design for change, design space, design time, domain-oriented design environments, Envisionment and Discovery Collaboratory, interactive art, open systems, SER model, social capital, underdesign, unself-conscious cultures of design, use time, value-feelings.},

	abstract = {This dissertation employs ethnographic, interview, and historiographic methods to explore the emergence, design, and distinctive controversies surrounding the use of computer simulation models in water management and politics in California, together with the broader regime of numbers and governance which support them. The first part of the dissertation offers an archival grounding for current debates, exploring the histories of knowledge, government, measure, and representation by which California rivers have been brought within and helped to produce the distinctive "territorial embrace" of the late-modern state in California. Chapter Three surveys the literature on models and policy in the earth sciences, exploring the ambivalent epistemic status of models vis-{\`a}-vis more established theoretical, experimental and data forms. Chapter Four explores the role of models in the field of water management, from physical and analog traditions in the early to mid-twentieth century to the rise of computer simulation techniques beginning in the 1950s and accelerating over the 1980s and 1990s. Chapter Five considers two principal case studies: the State Water Project Reliability Report of 2002, and current efforts to update the California Water Plan, both delayed and/or substantially reshaped by controversies surrounding the legitimacy of modeling. As these and other cases of "doing hard politics with soft numbers" suggest, despite technical developments and widespread policy deployments in the past ten years, the status of model knowledge in public contexts remains fragile, subject to ever-present threats of technical, political, and institutional deconstruction. Because of this, the representational adequacy of models cannot be reduced or fixed at the level of technical practice or 'code itself', but resides in a dense and politically consequential web of social, technical and institutional practices. Pragmatically, I urge designers, policy-makers, activists, and other political actors to "attend to the infrastructure," i.e. pay adequate attention to the mundane details of design, history, and practice that play a large and growing role in shaping the deliberative character (or otherwise) of complex systems of epistemic, material, and social order.},

	abstract = {This paper considers the elements and challenges of heterogeneous data management and interdisciplinary collaboration, drawing from the literatures on participatory design, computer-supported cooperative work, and science studies to support information design efforts within the rapidly evolving world of large-scale science projects. Certain tensions are embedded in such collaborative projects, being rooted in distinctive disciplinary knowledge interests brought to the table and expressed in occasionally divergent understandings of project rationale, identity and success. A continuum of strategies exist for dealing with such tensions. In this paper, we discuss two of these: a strategy of 'mindful variety' built around an appreciation of disciplinary, organizational and biographical heterogeneneity of collaborative ventures; and attention to the proliferation of 'boundary objects' and shared languages between and within adjacent communities of practice. These strategies are considered specifically through the lens of an Ocean Informatics Environment (OIE), a concept that joins ocean, information, and social scientists working to construct locally responsive, adaptive and scalable information infrastructures for the practice of ocean science. Our team seeks to design an environment supporting reflexive and heterogeneous data practices responsive to the multiple work worlds of ocean science. We consider the development of an ethic of collaborative care, offered as a working principle for the identification, preservation and bridging of disciplinary difference in the cooperative design of scientific work settings as one of several strategies emerging from ongoing work.},

More recently, crisis informatics has developed an analysis of these phenomena from social and computational perspectives. To further to assess the consequences and opportunities of technological developments in the field, we re-interpret the concept of informating, first developed by Zuboff to describe the impacts of technological changes on the workplace during the 1980s. We draw on four contemporary examples of how ICT is changing the way we conceive of and respond to natural hazards to offer a new reading of the concept of informating in the growing field of crisis informatics. We then argue that this concept suggests the adoption of a more critical agenda for crisis informatics research to better respond to contemporary challenges presented by climate change and natural hazards.},

By presenting an honest assessment of the successes and shortcomings of the first iteration of a hackathon, we explain how we re-structured the second "Make the Breast Pump Not Suck" hackathon in service of equity and systems design. Key to our re-imagining of conventional innovation structures is a focus on experience design, where joy and play serve as key strategies to help people and institutions build relationships across lines of difference. We conclude with a discussion of design principles applicable not only to designers of events, but to social movement researchers and HCI scholars trying to address oppression through the design of technologies and socio-technical systems.},

Seamful design emphasizes configurability, user appropriation, and revelation of complexity, ambiguity or inconsistency. Here we review these literatures together and argue that, rather than rival approaches, seamful and seamless design are complements, each emphasizing different aspects of downstream user agency. Ultimately, we situate this debate within the larger, perennial discussion about the strategic revelation and concealment of human and technological operations, and therein the role of design.},

We present the results of an interview study with twenty data practitioners, from which we derive four high-level user needs for tool support. We compare them against the capabilities of twenty systems that are commonly associated with data activities, including data publishing software, wikis, web-based collaboration tools, and online community platforms. Our findings suggest that data-centric collaborative work would benefit from: structured documentation of data and its lifecycle; advanced affordances for conversations among collaborators; better change control; and custom data access.

	abstract = {With the rise of big data, there has been an increasing need for practitioners in this space and an increasing opportunity for researchers to understand their workflows and design new tools to improve it. Data science is often described as data-driven, comprising unambiguous data and proceeding through regularized steps of analysis. However, this view focuses more on abstract processes, pipelines, and workflows, and less on how data science workers engage with the data. In this paper, we build on the work of other CSCW and HCI researchers in describing the ways that scientists, scholars, engineers, and others work with their data, through analyses of interviews with 21 data science professionals. We set five approaches to data along a dimension of interventions: Data as given; as captured; as curated; as designed; and as created. Data science workers develop an intuitive sense of their data and processes, and actively shape their data. We propose new ways to apply these interventions analytically, to make sense of the complex activities around data practices.},

Patients or caregivers have to rely on their own to overcome barriers and fix breakdowns in order to obtain necessary service, that is, infrastructuring work to make the healthcare infrastructure work for them. So far little attention has been paid to such infrastructuring work in healthcare. We present an interview study of 32 U.S. parents of young children to discuss the work of infrastructuring our participants carry out to deal with breakdowns within the healthcare infrastructure. We report how they repaired unexpected failures happening at the individual level, aligned components at organizational and cross-organizational level, and circumvented infrastructural constraints (e.g., policy and financial ones) that were perceived as ambiguous and demanding. We discuss infrastructuring work in light of the literature on patients' and caregivers' work, reflect upon the notion of patient engagement, and explore nuances along several dimensions of infrastructuring work.},

Research shows that social support and personal narrative construction are important when recovering from personal crises and traumatic events. As an online community focused on writing fanfiction and also consisting of a large number of LGBTQ members, transformative fandom provides an opportunity to examine the relationship between support, crisis, and narrative. Through an interview study with 31 LGBTQ fanfiction authors, our findings mirror Herman's model of trauma recovery: these spaces self-organize to support recovery work through constructing "community narratives" that help LGBTQ people establish safety when exploring their identity and build LGBTQ support structures without publicly outing themselves before they are ready, challenge stereotypes, and support others through reshaping existing media that perpetuate inaccurate or harmful LGBTQ narratives. These online communities embody "selective visibility"--that is, though not specifically designed as support structures for identity work and recovery, their design allows people to selectively find and create communities of support for stigmatized issues that they might be unable to safely seek out in other spaces. Based on lessons learned, we generate insights that can inform the design of safe support spaces online.},

The mobilities paradigm not only remedies the academic neglect of various movements, of people, objects, information and ideas. It also gathers new empirical sensitivities, analytical orientations, methods and motivations to examine important social and material phenomena and fold social science insight into responses. After an outline of the mobilities paradigm, this article provides a wide-ranging review of emergent `mobile methods' of studying (im)mobilities.

It shows that processes taking place when research technology makes physical contact with the objects targeted in research endeavours shape the subsequent data journeys and the practices of creating scientific knowledge. The chapter is based on a case study of ecological monitoring in ocean sciences and zooms in on the practice of sampling the oceans{\textquoteright} ecosystems with mechanical sampling devices that are towed regularly by commercial ships. I propose an understanding of materiality as the integration of physical matter from various sources so as to constitute a new entity, in this case a research sample containing plankton organisms. The material integration is followed by material continuity, the preservation of the sample throughout several if not all stages of the research process without a change of medium. This two-fold understanding is an attempt to ground the notion of {\textquotedblleft}materiality{\textquotedblright} epistemologically rather than ontologically. As shown with empirical examples, material interactions are the origin of resistances or challenges which unfold throughout the research process as scientists intend to create knowledge by manipulating and analysing physical objects. The scientific practices are shaped by investigating, resolving, and working around these challenges.},

Given the amount of data stored in modern databases, raw network representations are typically hairballs that provides researchers little useful information other than that lots of things interact. Cytoscape was created by systems biologists to facilitate moving beyond hairballs to informative representations. It provides tools for clustering nodes and annotating them according to what is known about the objects represented. I provide examples of how Cytoscape has been deployed to develop new knowledge about biological mechanisms. Cytoscape has been made freely available, and I describe how a large interational community of researchers has created Apps that enable researchers to make a number of more specialized inferences.

It builds on the case study of a {\textquoteleft}data mash-up{\textquoteright} infrastructure for research with environmental, weather and population health data. I problematise the extent to which scientists reusing digital computer data heavily manipulate the sources through complex and situated calculative operations, as they attempt to re-situate data well beyond the epistemic community in which they originated, and adapt them to different theoretical frameworks, methods and evidential standards. The chapter interrogates the consequent relationship between derivative data and the data sources from which they originate. The deep relationality of scientific computer data is multi-layered and scaffolded, as it depends on relations between various kinds of data, computing technologies, assumptions, theoretical scaffoldings, hypotheses and other features of the situation at hand.},

In my chapter, I will take a close look at a small subset of the original datasheets Boas used in his surveys, and how he and other scientists processed the data in later publications. My analysis will reveal that the extraordinary potential for travel and re-use of Boas{\textquoteright}s data crucially depended on the way in which he designed his surveys. Alongside recording standard anthropometric variables, Boas collected genealogical and geographical information on the individuals measured, which allowed him to flexibly classify data in a variety of ways.

In this paper, I explore how data journey in case reports, with particular focus on the earliest stages of the process, namely from creation and publication of case reports to the initial re-uses of them and data within them. I investigate key themes relating to case reporting and re-use, including factors which seem to smooth the path along which the data captured by a case report journey via broader citation patterns and detailed qualitative analysis of highly re-used case reports. This analysis reveals some of the key factors associated with the case reports whose data have greater amounts of journeying including publication in a general medical journal; that the data have broader implications and evidential value for topical or even urgent issues for instance in public health; and use in the case report of multiple research methods or concepts from diverse subfields. These findings along with standardization of case reporting are shown to have epistemological implications, particularly for how we understand the journeying of data.},

I focus on the presumed detection, in 2004, of a galaxy at record distance from Earth. The original data became public at the time of publication and were soon re-used and supplemented with new observations by other teams. Data re-using scientists sought to reconstruct the practices used in making the discovery claim, and found them at fault. This allowed them to suggest the repair of data and of data use practices, which were subsequently taken up by the scientists who had claimed the discovery. I argue that this work was enabled by astronomy{\textquoteright}s discipline-specific architecture for observation, of which objectual, technological and institutional elements provide contexts and resources for achieving the reflexive repair of data and data use practices. These astronomers experience data journeys more as reflexive loopings in screen-mediated work than as itineraries across physical sites or geographies.},

I show that the design of this system involves both theoretical and experimental judgments each of which has different functions in the initial data journey through which usable data are constructed out of collision events detected by the ATLAS detector. I also explore what requirements the foregoing judgments impose on the LHC data in terms of usability, mobility and mutability. I argue that in present-day HEP experiments these aspects of data are distinct but related to each other due to the fact that they are subjected to some common requirements imposed by the theoretical and experimental judgments involved in the design of data acquisition systems.},

From 1962 until 2016, the Randomized Clinical Trial (RCT) was the reference test for most regulatory agencies. Today, the standards are about to change, and in this chapter we draw on the idea of the data journey to illuminate the trade-offs involved. The 21st Century Cures Act (21CCA) allows for the use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for the assessment of different treatment indications for already approved drugs. This might arguably shorten the testing period, bringing treatments to patients faster. Yet, EHR are not generated for testing purposes and no amount of standardization and curation can fully make up for their potential flaws as evidence of safety and efficacy. The more noise in the data, the more mistakes regulators are likely to make in granting market access to new drugs. In this paper we will discuss the different dimensions of this journey: the different sources and levels of curation involved, the speed at which they can travel, and the level of risk of regulatory error involved as compared with the RCT standard. We are going to defend that what counts as evidence, at the end of the journey, depends on the risk definition and threshold regulators work with.},

Observational practices that remain confined to physical localities face various impasses in the era of digital platforms. Combining participant observation in workplaces where digital platforms are accessed with technical walkthroughs of their interfaces, I make a case for renewing interface ethnography. On one hand, technical walkthroughs reveal the sociocultural assumptions embedded in interfaces and the ways in which their affordances generate symbolic meanings. However, on the other hand, participant observation foregrounds emic perspectives on digital platforms within communities of practice. Based on an ethnographic study of a Norwegian software firm, I argue that the integration of the walkthrough method with participant observation enables researchers to trace the twofold meaning construction inherent in communities of practice whose skilled labor is orientated toward digital platforms. This fusion of methods expands the scope of ethnographic knowledge across the digital-physical continuum.},

To address this, we designed a service learning course that partnered students with non-profit organizations to help with their technology challenges. The service project was deliberately left open-ended to force students (and partners) to tackle important questions around project scoping and impact. By drawing parallels to soil care practices, we explore how "care time" emerged in this context, and how the incorporation of ambiguity galvanized students, community, and faculty to make time to navigate it. This led to non-tangible yet vital outcomes such as overcoming social limitations, building symbiotic relationships, and enacting acts of care necessary for more ethical orchestration of technology.},

	abstract = {Everyday life is increasingly mediated by technology. Technology is rapidly growing capacity and complexity, especially evident in developments in artificial intelligence and big data analytics. As human-computer interaction (HCI) endeavors to examine and theorize how people act and interact with the ever-evolving technology, an important, emerging concern is how the self-the totality of internal qualities such as consciousness and agency-plays out in relation to the technology-mediated external world. To analyze this question, we draw from Michel Foucault's ethics of "care of the self," which examines how the self is constituted through conscious and reflective work on self-transformation. We present three case studies to illustrate how individuals carry out practices of the self to reflect upon and negotiate their relationship with technology. We discuss the importance of examining the self and foreground the notion of care of the self in HCI research and design.},

Through these accounts we introduce the relational concepts of Blockchain Assemblages and Whiteboxing. Blockchain assemblages comprise configurations of digital and analogue artefacts that are entangled with imaginaries about the current and future state of the Blockchain information infrastructure. Rather than being a black box, Blockchain assemblages alternate between being dynamic and stable entities. We propose Whiteboxing as the sociomaterial process which drives blockchain assemblages in their dynamic state to be (re)configured, while related artefacts and imaginaries are simultaneously transformed, creating dynamic representations. Whiteboxing is triggered during disconfirming events when representations are discovered as problematic. Complementing existing historical accounts demonstrating technologies in the making, the contribution of this paper, proposes whiteboxing as an analytical concept which allows us to unpack how contemporary technologies are created through entrepreneurial activities.},

	abstract = {Although the current developments in ubiquitous and pervasive computing are driven largely by technological opportunities, they have radical implications not just for technology design but also for the ways in which we experience and interact with computation. In particular, the move of computation {\textquoteleft}off the desktop{\textquoteright} and into the world, whether embedded in the environment around us or carried or worn on our bodies, suggests that computation is beginning to manifest itself in new ways as an aspect of the everyday environment. One particularly interesting issue in this transformation is the move from a concern with virtual spaces to a concern with physical ones. Basically, once computation moves off the desktop, computer science suddenly has to be concerned with where it might have gone. Whereas computer science and human-computer interaction have previously been concerned with disembodied cognition, they must now look more directly at embodied action and bodily encounters between people and technology. In this paper, we explore some of the implications of the development of ubiquitous computing for encounters with space. We look on space here as infrastructure{\textemdash}not just a technological infrastructure, but an infrastructure through which we experience the world. Drawing on studies of both the practical organization of space and the cultural organization of space, we begin to explore the ways in which ubiquitous computing may condition, and be conditioned by, the social organization of everyday space.},

              Plans and Situated Actions
              has been influential in HCI (Human Computer Interaction). The book is often discussed with reference to ethnographic fieldwork, sometimes being cited as if it were a field study. However, the book uses examples from a laboratory study and contains criticisms of ethnography. This article explores how and why Suchman carried out a laboratory study. Based upon this exploration, it argues that social analysis in HCI does not necessitate fieldwork outside the laboratory. More broadly, the paper argues that an appreciation of Plans and Situated Actions can help in moving towards forms of social analysis that span both the laboratory and the world outside. If there is to be a {\textquotedblleft}turn to the wild{\textquotedblright} in HCI, this should not be a turn away from the laboratory but a turn away from research methods that ignore human practice. This is not to defend laboratory experiments, but to defend laboratory-based studies that explicate technology in practice.},

Complementing these studies, this paper examines how scientists use the digitally mediated, shared availability of {\textquotedblleft}natural{\textquotedblright} environments and objects for infrastructural purposes. Drawing on ethnography and informed by ethnomethodology, I focus on the uses of the sky in astronomical observation. Astronomical research is oriented to observing, and re-observing, sources on the sky, making it its topic. Yet, the sky is also an infrastructural resource, as it provides stable saliences that can be used alongside existing records for ordering work, diagnosing trouble with artifacts in data, and repairing data across diverse sites of practice. I consider a case in which such uses of the sky were new to researchers working in a novel domain, and one in which such uses were already established, but new to a student being inducted to its work. In both cases properties of the sky became salient through being mediated digitally. As existing records and new observations were made available to a single computational order, these data became accessible to what Melvin Pollner called mundane reason, wherein ceteris paribus clauses are used reflexively to maintain a world in common. Although the sky may appear to be an extreme case, I argue that other mediated environments and objects, and the reflexive practices through which these are engaged, have similar infrastructural uses in other disciplines.},

Arlette Farge's Le Go?t de l'archive is widely regarded as a historiographical classic. While combing through two-hundred-year-old judicial records from the Archives of the Bastille, historian Farge was struck by the extraordinarily intimate portrayal they provided of the lives of the poor in pre-Revolutionary France, especially women. She was seduced by the sensuality of old manuscripts and by the revelatory power of voices otherwise lost. In The Allure of the Archives, she conveys the exhilaration of uncovering hidden secrets and the thrill of venturing into new dimensions of the past.  Originally published in 1989, Farge's classic work communicates the tactile, interpretive, and emotional experience of archival research while sharing astonishing details about life under the Old Regime in France.

	abstract = {This essay explores the consequences for historians{\textquoteright} research of the twinned transnational and digitized turns. The accelerating digitization of primary and secondary sources and the rise of full-text web-based search to access information within them has transformed historians{\textquoteright} research practice, radically diminishing the role of place-specific prior expertise as a prerequisite to discovery. Indeed, we can now find information without knowing where to look. This has incited remarkably little reflection among mainstream historians, but the consequences are profound. What has become newly possible? How do the new digital affordances relate to the current boom in transnational topics and approaches? How do the reach, speed, and granularity of digitized search impact our ability to reconstruct the supranational past? This essay heralds the novel forms of knowledge-generation made possible by technological transformations. It also attempts an accounting of all the ancillary learning that international research in an analog world once required. What kinds of knowledge and insight did place-based research across borders instill? What are the intellectual and political consequences of leaving that behind?},

	abstract = {The goal of this article is twofold: to clarify the tenets of convergence research and to motivate such research in the hazards and disaster field. Here, convergence research is defined as an approach to knowledge production and action that involves diverse teams working together in novel ways {\textendash} transcending disciplinary and organizational boundaries {\textendash} to address vexing social, economic, environmental, and technical challenges in an effort to reduce disaster losses and promote collective well-being. The increasing frequency and intensity of disasters coupled with the growth of the field suggests an urgent need for a more coherent approach to help guide what we study, who we study, how we conduct studies, and who is involved in the research process itself. This article is written through the lens of the activities of the National Science Foundation-supported CONVERGE facility, which was established in 2018 as the first social science-led component of the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI). Convergence principles and the Science of Team Science undergird the work of CONVERGE, which brings together networks of researchers from geotechnical engineering, the social sciences, structural engineering, nearshore systems, operations and systems engineering, sustainable material management, and interdisciplinary science and engineering. CONVERGE supports and advances research that is conceptually integrative, and this article describes a convergence framework that includes the following elements: (1) identifying researchers; (2) educating and training researchers; (3) setting a convergence research agenda that is problem-focused and solutions-based; (4) connecting researchers and coordinating functionally and demographically diverse research teams; and (5) supporting and funding convergence research, data collection, data sharing, and solutions implementation.},

	abstract = {A historical study of Chile's twin experiments with cybernetics and socialism, and what they tell us about the relationship of technology and politics. In Cybernetic Revolutionaries, Eden Medina tells the history of two intersecting utopian visions, one political and one technological. The first was Chile's experiment with peaceful socialist change under Salvador Allende; the second was the simultaneous attempt to build a computer system that would manage Chile's economy. Neither vision was fully realized--Allende's government ended with a violent military coup; the system, known as Project Cybersyn, was never completely implemented--but they hold lessons for today about the relationship between technology and politics. Drawing on extensive archival material and interviews, Medina examines the cybernetic system envisioned by the Chilean government--which was to feature holistic system design, decentralized management, human-computer interaction, a national telex network, near real-time control of the growing industrial sector, and modeling the behavior of dynamic systems. She also describes, and documents with photographs, the network's Star Trek-like operations room, which featured swivel chairs with armrest control panels, a wall of screens displaying data, and flashing red lights to indicate economic emergencies. Studying project Cybersyn today helps us understand not only the technological ambitions of a government in the midst of political change but also the limitations of the Chilean revolution. This history further shows how human attempts to combine the political and the technological with the goal of creating a more just society can open new technological, intellectual, and political possibilities. Technologies, Medina writes, are historical texts; when we read them we are reading history.},

Award-winning scholars and authors Thomas R. Lindlof and Bryan C. Taylor guide readers through every step of the qualitative process, from developing research topics and questions through writing a final report. Readers are given numerous examples of work in the field to illustrate how studies are designed, carried out, written, evaluated, and related to theory. In addition to covering the theories and methods currently used in qualitative communication research, the authors also discuss important trends influencing the future of that research, helping readers make informed judgments about the significance and consequences of recent trends.  New to the Fourth Edition:  A new chapter titled "The Diversity of Qualitative Research in Communication Subfields" provides readers with a complete guide to the field{\textquoteright}s distinctive subfields and enables readers to identify the research agenda that best represents their own interests. Two rising subfields {\textendash} Political Communication and Communication Activism {\textendash} were added, resulting in thirteen subfields covered.  Two major phases of data analysis have been split into separate chapters, enabling readers to concentrate on the initial steps of analysis before moving on to the interpretation phase of analysis.  Discussions of important intellectual and institutional trends currently reshaping the landscape of qualitative research, including Materialist Theory, Big Data, and Open-Access publishing, provide readers with cutting-edge knowledge and skills that affect what they study and how they study it. An analysis of new developments in media and technology shows readers how social media networks and other digital platforms are not only topics of research, but also the means for collecting and analyzing data.},

How did we come to view the nation as the inevitable context for history, and what happens when we move outside those boundaries? What is the relation among popular, academic, and public history, and how should we evaluate sources? What is the difference between description and interpretation, and how do we balance them?

It is well known that among primitive peoples the measurement of time is commonly related to familiar processes in the cycle of work or of domestic chores. Puritanism, in its marriage of convenience with industrial capitalism, was the agent which converted men to new valuations of time; which taught children even in their infancy to improve each shining hour; and which saturated men's minds with the equation, time is money. One recurrent form of revolt within Western industrial capitalism, whether bohemian or beatnik, has often taken the form of flouting the urgency of respectable time-values.},

	abstract = {In Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes, Robert M. Emerson, Rachel I. Fretz, and Linda L. Shaw present a series of guidelines, suggestions, and practical advice for creating useful fieldnotes in a variety of settings, demystifying a process that is often assumed to be intuitive and impossible to teach. Using actual unfinished notes as examples, the authors illustrate options for composing, reviewing, and working fieldnotes into finished texts. They discuss different organizational and descriptive strategies and show how transforming direct observations into vivid descriptions results not simply from good memory but from learning to envision scenes as written. A good ethnographer, they demonstrate, must learn to remember dialogue and movement like an actor, to see colors and shapes like a painter, and to sense moods and rhythms like a poet. This new edition reflects the extensive feedback the authors have received from students and instructors since the first edition was published in 1995. As a result, they have updated the race, class, and gender section, created new sections on coding programs and revising first drafts, and provided new examples of working notes. An essential tool for budding social scientists, the second edition of Writing Ethnographic Fieldnotes will be invaluable for a new generation of researchers entering the field.},

	abstract = {Recent decades have seen a dramatic shift away from social forms of gambling played around roulette wheels and card tables to solitary gambling at electronic terminals. Slot machines, revamped by ever more compelling digital and video technology, have unseated traditional casino games as the gambling industry's revenue mainstay. Addiction by Design takes readers into the intriguing world of machine gambling, an increasingly popular and absorbing form of play that blurs the line between human and machine, compulsion and control, risk and reward. Drawing on fifteen years of field research in Las Vegas, anthropologist Natasha Dow Sch{\"u}ll shows how the mechanical rhythm of electronic gambling pulls players into a trancelike state they call the "machine zone," in which daily worries, social demands, and even bodily awareness fade away. Once in the zone, gambling addicts play not to win but simply to keep playing, for as long as possible--even at the cost of physical and economic exhaustion. In continuous machine play, gamblers seek to lose themselves while the gambling industry seeks profit. Sch{\"u}ll describes the strategic calculations behind game algorithms and machine ergonomics, casino architecture and "ambience management," player tracking and cash access systems--all designed to meet the market's desire for maximum "time on device." Her account moves from casino floors into gamblers' everyday lives, from gambling industry conventions and Gamblers Anonymous meetings to regulatory debates over whether addiction to gambling machines stems from the consumer, the product, or the interplay between the two. Addiction by Design is a compelling inquiry into the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance, offering clues to some of the broader anxieties and predicaments of contemporary life. At stake in Sch{\"u}ll's account of the intensifying traffic between people and machines of chance is a blurring of the line between design and experience, profit and loss, control and compulsion.},

	abstract = {"A powerful document of the inner lives and creative visions of men and women rendered invisible by America{\textquoteright}s prison system. More than two million people are currently behind bars in the United States. Incarceration not only separates the imprisoned from their families and communities; it also exposes them to shocking levels of deprivation and abuse and subjects them to the arbitrary cruelties of the criminal justice system. Yet, as Nicole Fleetwood reveals, America{\textquoteright}s prisons are filled with art. Despite the isolation and degradation they experience, the incarcerated are driven to assert their humanity in the face of a system that dehumanizes them. Based on interviews with currently and formerly incarcerated artists, prison visits, and the author{\textquoteright}s own family experiences with the penal system, Marking Time shows how the imprisoned turn ordinary objects into elaborate works of art. Working with meager supplies and in the harshest conditions{\textemdash}including solitary confinement{\textemdash}these artists find ways to resist the brutality and depravity that prisons engender. The impact of their art, Fleetwood observes, can be felt far beyond prison walls. Their bold works, many of which are being published for the first time in this volume, have opened new possibilities in American art. As the movement to transform the country{\textquoteright}s criminal justice system grows, art provides the imprisoned with a political voice. Their works testify to the economic and racial injustices that underpin American punishment and offer a new vision of freedom for the twenty-first century."},

Ernst argues that the scientific inquiry into the nature of time is enriched by the media-technological context. The book exposes a media theoretical approach to contemporary media culture that derives from the combination of philosophical reflection on the essence of technology and a close analysis of technological devices themselves. Ultimately Ernst addresses a fundamental concern of past, contemporary and future media culture: the position of technology in culture under the focused perspective of its tempor(e)alities.},

This statement could describe the scholarly itinerary of Raymond Williams, who consistently argued for and sought to enact a synthesis of theory and method capable of grasping the complex relationships among communication, culture, social formation, and historical change. In considering approaches to the study of the history of media and communication, it is worthwhile to begin with some clarification of terms. The history of media and communication history has also undergone reformulations. One of the best means of developing such an awareness is to become deeply familiar with the history and historiography of communication and media {\textendash} a basic requirement for scholars who want to do historical research in the field.},

The purpose of doing so is to enable researchers to be aware of how their subjectivity may be shaping their inquiry and its outcomes. In this paper I demonstrate the pursuit of my subjectivity in the course of year-long fieldwork in a multiethnic high school.},

	abstract = {This article presents findings from TechTales, a participatory design research (PDR) project where learning scientists, public library staff members, informal science educators, and staff members from Native-American-serving organizations collaborated to design a family-based robotics workshop that was grounded in storytelling. We approach this by engaging Indigenous ways of knowing and being from a sociocultural learning theory perspective. Through analyzing families-in-interaction as they constructed dioramas with robotics that told their family stories, we explore how cultivating consequential learning environments in STEM is intimately intertwined with historicity, knowledge systems, and the agentic positioning of learners to design new technologies. We find that using storywork as the design focus of building dioramas created learning environments where computer programing and robotics became dynamic tools toward family-making, collaboration, and the active presencing of Indigenous knowledge systems and cultural practices. Living and interrelating with story and its knowledge systems through making were enactments of Indigenous resurgence in everyday ways. From a structure of social practices perspective, this opens up learning spaces for engagement in STEM-Art practices and in relation to other social practices of consequence, such as cultural flourishing and affiliation, collaboration and family-making, and societal repositioning.},

	abstract = {This paper is motivated by a methodological interest in how to investigate information infrastructures as an empirical, real-world phenomenon. We argue that research on information infrastructures should not be captive to the prevalent method choice of small-scale and short-term studies. Instead research should address the challenges of empirically studying the heterogeneous, extended and complex phenomena of infrastructuring with an emphasis on the necessarily emerging and open-ended processual qualities of information infrastructures. While existing literature identifies issues that make the study of infrastructuring demanding, few propose ways of addressing these challenges. In this paper we review characteristics of information infrastructures identified in the literature that present challenges for their empirical study. We look to current research in the social sciences, particularly anthropology and science and technology studies (STS) that focus on how to study complex and extended phenomena ethnographically, to provide insight into the study of infrastructuring. Specifically, we reflect on infrastructuring as an object of ethnographic inquiry by building on the notion of {\textquotedblleft}constructing the field.{\textquotedblright} Recent developments in how to conceptualize the ethnographic field are tied both to longstanding traditions and novel developments in anthropology and STS for studying extended and complex phenomena. Through a discussion of how dimensions of information infrastructures have been addressed practically, methodologically, and theoretically we aim to link the notion of constructing the ethnographic field with views on infrastructuring as a particular kind of object of inquiry. Thus we aim to provide an ethnographically sensitive and methodologically oriented {\textquotedblleft}opening{\textquotedblright} for an alternative ontology for studying infrastructuring ethnographically.},

We performed a contextualized walkthrough of the Map with producers and stewards in six scientific software ecosystems that use the R language. We found that they work to maximize diversity rather than quantity of uses, and to minimize coordination costs. We also found that summarized usage data would be useful for justifying ecosystem work to funding agencies; and we discovered a variety of more granular usage needs that would help in adding or maintaining features.},

Instead, islands become instruments of productive knowledge, laboratories for investigation and learning, fundamental to an alternative, correlational, epistemology. In analysing these approaches, we take the prolific trope of islands as the {\textquoteleft}canaries in the coalmine{\textquoteright} in order to draw out the ontological implications of instrumentalising islands as {\textquoteleft}correlational machines{\textquoteright} in the Anthropocene. We raise fundamental problems with this literal instrumentalisation of islands and islanders, drawing out how these logics reduce island life to merely sensing and attuning to the co-relational entanglements of the Anthropocene, rather than offering higher normative aspirations for political change.},

	abstract = {For over a century, field stations have been important entryways for scientists to study and make important discoveries about the natural world. They are centers of research, conservation, education, and public outreach, often embedded in natural environments that range from remote to densely populated urban locations. Because they lack traditional university departmental boundaries, researchers at field stations have the opportunity to converge their science disciplines in ways that can change careers and entire fields of inquiry. Field stations provide physical space for immersive research, hands-on learning, and new collaborations that are otherwise hard to achieve in the everyday bustle of research and teaching lives on campus. But the separation from university campuses that allows creativity to flourish also creates challenges. Sometimes, field stations are viewed as remote outposts and are overlooked because they tend to be away from population centers and their home institutions. This view is exacerbated by the lack of empirical evidence that can be used to demonstrate their value to science and society.
Enhancing the Value and Sustainability of Field Stations and Marine Laboratories in the 21st Century summarizes field stations' value to science, education, and outreach and evaluates their contributions to research, innovation, and education. This report suggests strategies to meet future research, education, outreach, infrastructure, funding, and logistical needs of field stations. Today's technologies - such as streaming data, remote sensing, robot-driven monitoring, automated DNA sequencing, and nanoparticle environmental sensors - provide means for field stations to retain their special connection to nature and still interact with the rest of the world in ways that can fuel breakthroughs in the environmental, physical, natural, and social sciences. The intellectual and natural capital of today's field stations present a solid platform, but many need enhancements of infrastructure and dynamic leadership if they are to meet the challenges of the complex problems facing the world. This report focuses on the capability of field stations to address societal needs today and in the future.},

	abstract = {"This is the best qualitative methods book I{\textquoteright}ve seen, especially among books aimed at undergraduate audiences." {\textemdash}Michael Irvin Arrington, Indiana State University  Qualitative Communication Research Methods, Fourth Edition introduces readers to qualitative research in speech and mass communication. Award-winning scholars and authors Thomas R. Lindlof and Bryan C. Taylor guide readers through every step of the qualitative process, from developing research topics and questions through writing a final report. Readers are given numerous examples of work in the field to illustrate how studies are designed, carried out, written, evaluated, and related to theory. In addition to covering the theories and methods currently used in qualitative communication research, the authors also discuss important trends influencing the future of that research, helping readers make informed judgments about the significance and consequences of recent trends.  New to the Fourth Edition:  A new chapter titled "The Diversity of Qualitative Research in Communication Subfields" provides readers with a complete guide to the field{\textquoteright}s distinctive subfields and enables readers to identify the research agenda that best represents their own interests. Two rising subfields {\textendash} Political Communication and Communication Activism {\textendash} were added, resulting in thirteen subfields covered.  Two major phases of data analysis have been split into separate chapters, enabling readers to concentrate on the initial steps of analysis before moving on to the interpretation phase of analysis.  Discussions of important intellectual and institutional trends currently reshaping the landscape of qualitative research, including Materialist Theory, Big Data, and Open-Access publishing, provide readers with cutting-edge knowledge and skills that affect what they study and how they study it. An analysis of new developments in media and technology shows readers how social media networks and other digital platforms are not only topics of research, but also the means for collecting and analyzing data.},

A notable instance of Internet-mediated science is the collaboratory, or a laboratory without walls, where scientists are connected to each other, to instruments, and to data independent of time and location. This paper explores past and current collaboratory efforts to identify both characteristics that define a collaboratory and factors of collaboratory use that predict scientific success and failure. The paper concludes with an assessment of directions for future collaboratory development.},

Federal research money encourages global science through the establishment of {\textquotedblleft}collaboratories.{\textquotedblright} We review over 10 years of field and laboratory investigations of collocated and noncollocated synchronous group collaborations. In particular, we compare collocated work with remote work as it is possible today and comment on the promise of remote work tomorrow. We focus on the sociotechnical conditions required for effective distance work and bring together the results with four key concepts: common ground, coupling of work, collaboration readiness, and collaboration technology readiness. Groups with high common ground and loosely coupled work, with readiness both for collaboration and collaboration technology, have a chance at succeeding with remote work. Deviations from each of these create strain on the relationships among teammates and require changes in the work or processes of collaboration to succeed. Often they do not succeed because distance still matters.},

	abstract = {Collaborative problem solving (CPS) is an essential skill for the 21st century workforce but remains difficult to assess. Understanding how CPS skills affect CPS performance outcomes can inform CPS training, task design, feedback design, and automated assessment. We investigated CPS behaviors (individually and in co-occurring patterns) in 101 (N~=~303) remote triads who collaboratively played an educational game called Physics Playground for 45-min. Team interactions consisted of open-ended speech occurring over videoconferencing with screen sharing. We coded participant's utterances relative to a CPS framework consisting of three facets (i.e., competencies such as constructing shared knowledge) manifested in 19 specific indicators (e.g., responds to others' questions/ideas). A matching technique was used to isolate the effect of CPS behaviors on CPS outcomes (quality of solution of a game level) controlling for pertinent covariates. Mixed-effects ordinal regression models indicated that proposing solution ideas and discussing results were the major predictors of CPS performance, and that team-member activities surrounding idea generation mattered. These findings highlighted the importance of both individual and collective contributions and social and cognitive skills in successful CPS outcomes.},
